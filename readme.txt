Dramastuff (pay attention if you want to use this at the time of release)

I've been master server banned for posting this, which I was told wasn't going to happen in a private conversation lol. The salt radiating from this simple plugin is reaching maximum levels, this plugin is not owned by any of the current JPXS staff, nor do they have the right to crash your servers, harass you, or ban you over it. (like they've done to me) This is an official release, not a leak. This version is an older version that only contains a mere 8 lines of code contributed by JPXS staff. We are giving you full permission to use this in any way the GPL-3.0 license allows you to, if the JPXS staff harass you over it, the only way I can send you is Alex Austin himself, which is a 50/50 and likely whatever he does they can bypass. 



Backstory

The plugin is finally out after years of being gatekept, infamously was responsible for making the actual game be replaced with a hangout server for a year. I thought I would release it on the day free weekend became available as sort of a extra souvenir. The game is literally cracked and the game is free, won't likely get an update, and is currently sitting at a whopping playercount of 15 players *per month*  
As of release I am done with sub rosa, I did everything I wanted to do with it, I made a sucessful server, I made friends, I made stuff for people, people laughed with me, I'd rather leave with one stale memory than to just play a dead game forever.
