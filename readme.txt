Dramastuff (can ignore)

I've been master server banned for posting this, which I was told wasn't going to happen in a private conversation lol. The salt radiating from this simple plugin is reaching maximum levels, I have been told that the jpxs staff would go delisting servers and crashing them if they got the plugin, which is equally as dumb and salty, the plugin is out there for a game so dead it gets 0 players on a daily basis, why does it have to be a huge situtation, if anything trying to stop players from using it is just extremely idiotic and foolish.

Edit: the plugin isn't owned by any of the current JPXS staff, the code written/helped by jpsh (a staff member) is a mere 8 lines, this plugin was released *by* FierriFiet and all decisions based on the code are his, meanwhile I've been master banned, harrassed, and my servers crashed constantly over it, this is not a leak, this an official release, screw you, although I can't do anything about it, you shouldn't be able to do that over this. And for any of the players wanting to use this, you can, he (the fricking CREATOR of the code) gives you permission to use it via the GPL-3.0 license, just avoid the massive salt boot that will fall on you if you do.


Backstory

The plugin is finally out after years of being gatekept, infamously was responsible for making the actual game be replaced with a hangout server for a year. I thought I would release it on the day free weekend became available as sort of a extra souvenir. The game is literally cracked and the game is free, won't likely get an update, and is currently sitting at a whopping playercount of 15 players *per month*
