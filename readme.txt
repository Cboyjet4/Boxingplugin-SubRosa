Dramastuff (read)

I've been master server banned for posting this, which I was told wasn't going to happen in a private conversation lol. The salt radiating from this simple plugin is reaching maximum levels, I have been told that the jpxs staff would go delisting servers and crashing them if they got the plugin, which is equally as dumb and salty, the plugin is out there, it isn't really yours, and was released at the hands of the creator through me. It's out there now and trying to stop it is just dumb.

Backstory (can ignore)

The plugin is finally out after years of being gatekept, infamously was responsible for making the actual game be replaced with a hangout server for a year. I thought I would release it on the day free weekend became available as sort of a extra souvenir. The game is literally cracked and the game is free, won't likely get an update, and is currently sitting at a whopping playercount of 15 players *per month*
